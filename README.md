# Overview

CyberScore is an educational web application designed to make cybersecurity approachable for everyday users.

Instead of overwhelming users with technical jargon, CyberScore asks a series of simple questions about password management, authentication, phishing awareness, backups, device security, privacy, and network security.

After completing the assessment, users receive:

- A personalized CyberScore (0–100)
- Overall security risk level
- Category-by-category security analysis
- Actionable improvement recommendations
- A security progression system ("Cyber Journey")
- Interactive checklist to track completed improvements
- Visual security dashboard with charts and progress indicators

The goal is to turn cybersecurity education into something interactive, measurable, and motivating.
